Purpose:
	Smooth1 is an example of an OpenGL program that loads a mesh (given in a .OBJ file) and renders it with various features. Learn how smooth works so that you can modify the code. You can find meshes in .OBJ format from various online sources (when you use sources, properly cite and acknowledge where you obtained them from).

	I modified the smooth program to implement a bsic graphic pipeline for rendering triangular meshes.

In all honesty I have added the makeFiles that should work in linux and in windows but have not been able to test them extensively. The idea is that when you run the program the first image you see is not the one I generated but instead what has been generated by the Smooth program. I modified the code so you can run my algorithm if you select 'y' once you select 'y' you can see the wireframe for the different figure. I have been using xCode on my mac and have been having issues with linking OpenGL and GLut in my makefiles. I will be attaching images of different objects I have been able to create with my program.
